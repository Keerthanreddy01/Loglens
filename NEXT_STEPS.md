## 🚀 Next Steps

### Option 1: Start Immediately (Recommended if you have time)
Begin with Week 1 tasks from `WEEK1_QUICKSTART.md`:

1. Create project structure (`frontend/`, `backend/`, `shared/`)
2. Initialize backend project
3. Set up Express.js server
4. Create basic configuration files
5. Test backend server runs

**Time Required**: 2-3 days  
**Difficulty**: Easy (mostly setup)

### Option 2: Review & Plan
Take time to:
1. Review `REFACTORING_ROADMAP.md` thoroughly
2. Understand the architecture changes
3. Plan your schedule (6-8 weeks)
4. Get team/stakeholder approval
5. Start when ready

### Option 3: Pause & Continue Later
Your authentication is working! You can:
1. Continue using the current application
2. Build features on the existing architecture
3. Return to refactoring when you have dedicated time
